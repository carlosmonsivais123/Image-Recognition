# Image-Recognition
I created a system to categorize images based on convolutional neural networks for the company that I interned for called Belami e-Commerce. 
I created it so that uploading the thousands of products every day and having to categorize them could be automated saving the opportunity 
cost of the time it would take the Data team to do so. The files below contain information regarding the Image Recognition using Convolutional 
Neural Networks Code.
